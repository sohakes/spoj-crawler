# br.spoj crawler
Crawl through your problems on http://br.spoj.com/ and download the accepted code into a submissions folder.

Just run `npm install` and `node crawler.js` and input your login and password.

The code is terribly written. That's why I'm publishing it, so I improve it after being ashamed of writing it.
